# FCFS-CPU-Scheduling
This code simulates a First-Come-First-Serve CPU Scheduler that takes 8 processes with varying different CPU and I/O burst lengths and processes them using a FCFS algorithm.

The FCFS Results Show:
* The Total Time
* The CPU Utilization (%)
* The Response Time for each process
* The Average Response Time
* The Waiting Time for each process
* The Average Waiting Time
* The Turnaround Time for each process
* The Average Turnaround Time
